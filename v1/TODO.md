[x] compare Iter model LLs for single and core
[x] fit new CNN core
[x] make function for amount of exc/inh across layers
[x] fit 1x CNN models on 0722, 0801, 0808 for comparison
[x] fit 2x CNN models on 0722, 0801, 0808 for comparison
[-] fit 2x iter models on 0722, 0801, 0808 for comparison
[ ] get the val_inds I used for the different datasets 
    and save them to a file I can reference (probably in my core paper folder for now)
[ ] see how the channels map to weight patterns and proj filters they prefer (do they fall into nice clusters?)
[ ] start writing for FYRP meeting
[ ] read Foundation Model paper



[ ] group the Iter filters by type, see how they correspond to the neurons
[ ] "" see how they correspond to electrode channels


------------
[x] fit new iter models on 0715, 0722, 0801, 0808 using the 7-iteration structure I used for the core model for proper comparison
[x] compare 1x 0715 model with 2x 0715 model (e.g. weights, etc.)
    [x] fit a model on 0722 and 0722 2x
    [X] compare the same cell in the 2x model to see if they have the same weights or not
[x] fix the generate_predictions() not using blocks
[x] write some bullet points about Student Seminar for the NACS orientation
[x] email to schedule FYRP meeting
[x] update 0727 and 0718 with NX and correct RFcenter locations (i.e. in screen coordinates not RF coordinates)
