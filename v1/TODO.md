[-] fit new iter models on 0715, 0722, 0801, 0808 using the 7-iteration structure I used for the core model for proper comparison
[ ] fit new CNN core
[ ] finish fitting CNN models on 0722, 0801, 0808 for similar comparison


[-] Does the core capture the same computations for the same neurons?
[ ] Keep exploring the questions in Obsidian.
[ ] start writing for FYRP meeting
[ ] read Foundation Model paper
------------


[x] compare 1x 0715 model with 2x 0715 model (e.g. weights, etc.)
    [x] fit a model on 0722 and 0722 2x
    [X] compare the same cell in the 2x model to see if they have the same weights or not
[x] fix the generate_predictions() not using blocks
[x] write some bullet points about Student Seminar for the NACS orientation
[x] email to schedule FYRP meeting
[x] update 0727 and 0718 with NX and correct RFcenter locations (i.e. in screen coordinates not RF coordinates)
