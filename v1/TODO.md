[x] update 0727 and 0718 with NX and correct RFcenter locations (i.e. in screen coordinates not RF coordinates)
[-] compare 1x 0715 model with 2x 0715 model (e.g. weights, etc.)
    [x] fit a model on 0722 and 0722 2x
    [ ] compare how different the 1x 0715 model and 2x models are
    [ ] plot weights for the different layers (make this a utility as well)
    [ ] compare the same cell in the 2x model to see if they have the same weights or not
    [ ] performance of 0715 by itself vs. 0715 within the core
[-] fit deep network using CNN instead of iterative network
    [-] first fit on 0715 data to test that it works
    [ ] then fit on 4 datasets (0715, 0722, 0801, 0808)
[ ] fix the generate_predictions() not using blocks
[ ] read Foundation Model paper

[ ] email to schedule FYRP meeting
[ ] start writing for FYRP meeting
[ ] write some bullet points about Student Seminar for the NACS orientation

[ ] direction-selectivity measure
[ ] orientation-selectivity measure
